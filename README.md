## API Documentation and Usage

### Authentication with JWT Token

Use **Postman**, **curl**, or any HTTP client to interact with the API.  
Make sure to include the JWT token in the request header for authorized endpoints:

```

#### Employee `position` Field

The `position` field accepts only the following values (case-sensitive):

Any other value will result in a validation error.
